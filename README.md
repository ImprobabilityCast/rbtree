# A Red-Black BST written with Rust

Why on earth did I do this? To learn about red-black trees and gain experience with Rust.

Having learned about both Rust and red-black trees, I refuse to work further on this project until I learn of a way implement a graph-like structure in Rust that doesn't involve me fighting the borrow checker.
